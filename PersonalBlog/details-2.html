        <h2 style="font-size: 20px;"> Coconut Bundt Cake with White Chocolate-Coconut Glaze </h2> <br><br><br>
        <p class="t" style= "font-size: 15px"> Last week flew by and before I knew it, it was time to plan the menu for Sunday dinner. Sundays
         have been a perfect opportunity for me to experiment with new dessert recipes, especially those that serve tons of people, since we 
         have help polishing it all off and don’t have it sitting around the house, tempting us for days. </p><br>

        <div> 
        <p class="t" style= "font-size: 15px"> I love anything with coconut during the spring and summertime, and Bundt cakes are not only easy 
        but they’re pretty and are perfect for serving a crowd. When I started flipping through a couple of my newer cookbooks and saw a recipe 
        for a coconut Bundt cake, dessert was immediately decided. </p>
        </div>

        <img src="images/CoconutBundtCake3.png" alt="CoconutBundtCake3" style="width:700px;">
        <div>
        <p class="t" style= "font-size: 15px"> I love that this can easily be mixed together in one bowl using my hand mixer; there's nothing 
            fussy about the mgredients or preparation, and it produces an absolutely perfect yellow cake. The layers are light
            but sturdy: butteo.• and moist: and the ideal base for your very favorite chocolate frosting. <br> <br>
            I used the chocolate frosting recipe from my ultimate chocolate cupcakes, and it was a wonderful 
            companion to this cake. The frosting is more buttery than sugary, satiny smooth and full of rich chocolate flavor.
            It glides on like a dream! </p>
        </div>

        <img src="images/CoconutBundtCake4.png" alt="CoconutBundtCake4" style="width:700px;">
        <div>
        <p class="t" style= "font-size: 15px"> This cake comes pretty darn close to a coconut pound cake, as there is quite a bit of butter, 
            sugar and eggs that help to create a wonderfully rich and moist cake. The coconut flavor is derived from a large amount of coconut 
            milk in both the cake and glaze, as well as a healthy dose of coconut extract. I also added toasted shredded coconut on top of the 
            glaze because, well, I feel like any type of coconut dessert needs to be topped with toasted coconut. <br><br>
            A couple of years ago, a coconut cake would have never ranked high on my list of cake options, but between the coconut cupcakes I 
            made last year and this cake, I am a total coconut convert. <br><br>
            Plus, after everyone went home yesterday, we were only left with two small pieces of cake. Win-win! </p>
