            <p class="t" style= "font-size: 15px"> Last week flew by and before I knew it, it was timee to plan the menu for Sunday dinner.
                Sundays have been a perfect opportunity for me to experiment with new dessert recipes, especcially those that serve tons of
                people, since we have help polishing it all off and don't have it sitting around the house, tempting us for days. </p>

            <img src="images/GermanChocolateCake.png" alt="GermanChocolateCake">
            <p class="t" style= "font-size: 15px"> I have long associated German Chocolate Cake with Father's Day, although I'm not entirely
            sure why. I think I remember my mom making it for my dad once or twice growing up (although never on Father's Day, ironically) and
            the correlation must have stuck somewhere along the way </p>
