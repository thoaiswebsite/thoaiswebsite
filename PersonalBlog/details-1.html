        <h2 style="font-size: 20px;"> Yellow cake with chocolate frosting </h2> <br><br><br>
        <p class="t" style= "font-size: 15px"> This fluffy vanilla cake recipe is the absolute best yellow cake from scratch and paired
             with the silky smooth chocolate frosting, you can't beat it for a classic birthday cake or any other celebration! </p>

        <p class="t" style= "font-size: 15px"> Are you a box mix yellow cake person? Or a from-scartch yellow cake person? <br> <br>
        Truth to be told, it's REALLY hard to replicate that always-moist-and-fluffy texture that
        everyone loves about a box cake mix, but at the same time, we also love homemade, right?! <br> <br>
        It took me a LONG time to find a homemade yellow cake that I really, really loved. Box cake
        mixes seem to always bake up perfectly fluffy and moist yellow cakes, and the ones I've had from bakeries have been great as well,
        but I just couldn't seem to replicate it at home no matter how many recipes I tried. (Consequently, I haven't had the same issue
        with chocolate cakes! See: Snickers Cake - the base recipe for all of my chocolate cakes!) <br> <br>
        Many were too dense, too dry, too chiffon-like, too fussy in their preparation. I just wanted
        a fantastic yellow cake recipe I could use for birthday cakes that was easy to make and turned out delicious. I came across this recipe
        from Joy while I was on the hunt for yet another recipe to test out for Joseph's birthday <br> <br>
        This was IT. The recipe that had eluded me for years! </p>
        </div>
        <img src="images/ClassicYellowCake3.png" alt="ClassicYellowCake3" style="width:700px;">
        <div>
        <p class="t" style= "font-size: 15px"> I love that this can easily be mixed together in one bowl using my hand mixer; there's nothing 
            fussy about the mgredients or preparation, and it produces an absolutely perfect yellow cake. The layers are light
            but sturdy: butteo.â€¢ and moist: and the ideal base for your very favorite chocolate frosting. <br> <br>
            I used the chocolate frosting recipe from my ultimate chocolate cupcakes, and it was a wonderful 
            companion to this cake. The frosting is more buttery than sugary, satiny smooth and full of rich chocolate flavor.
            It glides on like a dream! </p>

        <div>
        <p class="t" style= "font-size: 15px"> Yellow cake tends to be the elusive unicom of homemade baking; so many cakes can tum out too dry, 
            too crumbly, too dense, too combread-like, and I have one major piece of advice for ensuring yellow cake perfection: <br><br>
            <b>Make sure all of the ingredients listed "at room temperature" <span style= "font-size: 16px">ARE ACTUALLY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.</span></b> <br><br>
            I've totally been there and have used still-cool butter, eggs or dairy in a recipe when I'm in a hurry, 
            but it's actually vitally important here. Having all of those ingredients at room temperature ensures that they emulsify, which traps air 
            m the batter and, once in the oven, that air expands and produces a fluffy cake. <br><br>
            Room temperature ingredients also ensure that the batter comes together well and is ultra-smooth, 
            which keeps the resulting cake from bemg crumbly or combread-like </p>
